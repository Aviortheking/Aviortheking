### Desktop

For Desktop programs, depending on the projet I make them using [Electron]() when a Graphical interface is needed and Basic TS when working on Command line programs.

While most of Desktop apps I built were for companies I have some that are public
- [File Explorer](https://github.com/Aviortheking/Delta-File-Manager) - A test file explorer that need a lot of work ðŸ˜…

### Mobile

For Mobile Developpement I Mainly use [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/).
