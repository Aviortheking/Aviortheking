> So you know how to use _this_ or _this_ framework/library?

While I like to play with a lot of libraries/frameworks I mostly use renowed Frameworks/libraries for my current works

For the web I mostly work on [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) using [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and [React](https://reactjs.org/) as the main logic and [Stylus](https://stylus-lang.com/) as a style superset.

For Desktop programs, depending on the projet I make them using [Electron]() when a Graphical interface is needed and Basic TS when working on Command line programs.

For Mobile Developpement I Mainly use [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/).

## for the purest developper form here are some stats
